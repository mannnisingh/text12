        "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design software in a way that reflects the real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is centered around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the characteristics and behaviors common to all objects of that type.\n",
        "\n",
        "The four main principles of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation:** This involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inheritance:** This allows a new class to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class, fostering code reuse. The new class, called a subclass or derived class, can also have additional or overridden features. Inheritance promotes the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism:** This enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types or forms and provides a way to perform a single action in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It allows developers to focus on the relevant details of an object while ignoring irrelevant complexities.\n",

Everything in Python is an object, and every object has a type (class). Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, and it supports the creation and manipulation of objects.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Attributes:**\n",

        "   - **Definition:** Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class.\n",
        "   - **Scope:** They are defined at the class level and are the same for all instances of the class.\n",
        "   - **Access:** Class variables are accessed using the class name (`ClassName.variable`) or through an instance of the class (`object.variable`).\n",

        "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python class methods, the `self` parameter is a convention that refers to the instance of the class on which the method is invoked. It is the first parameter of instance methods and is used to access and modify the instance's attributes and call other methods within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the purpose of the `self` parameter:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reference to the Instance:**\n",
        "   - `self` allows a method to refer to the specific instance of the class on which the method is called. This is crucial for accessing and manipulating the instance's attributes and calling other methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Accessing Instance Variables:**\n",
        "   - Inside a method, you use `self` to access instance variables. For example, if a class has an attribute called `name`, you would use `self.name` to refer to the value of `name` for the specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Dog:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.name = name\n",

        "           print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calling Other Methods:**\n",
        "   - When a method needs to call another method within the same class, it uses `self` to do so. This ensures that the correct instance of the class is referenced.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Calculator:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, value):\n",
        "           self.result = value\n",
        "\n",
        "       def add(self, x):\n",
        "           self.result += x\n",
        "\n",
        "       def multiply(self, y):\n",
        "           self.result *= y\n",
        "\n",
        "   calc = Calculator(5)\n",
        "   calc.add(3)\n",
        "   calc.multiply(2)\n",
        "   print(calc.result)  # Output: 16\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Creating and Accessing New Attributes:**\n",
        "   - If a method creates new attributes during its execution, it uses `self` to store and access those attributes, making them instance-specific.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, make):\n",
        "           self.make = make\n",
        "\n",
        "       def start_engine(self):\n",
        "           self.engine_status = \"Running\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
        "   my_car.start_engine()\n",
        "   print(my_car.engine_status)  # Output: Running\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that `self` is a convention, and you could technically name it differently, but using `self` is widely adopted and helps maintain clarity and consistency in code. When defining an instance method within a class, always include `self` as the first parameter."
